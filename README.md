# Canadian Citizenship Preparation Test

Canadian Citizenship Preparation test was my first experiment using React Native and it was used as tool for myself to be able to study for the real test.
Whether you're studying for the Canadian Citizenship exam or testing your knowledge of Canadian history, The Canadian Citizenship Test is a fun way to help you to achieve that. More than 400 questions are included in the app to aid you in your preparation for the official test, all of them were taken from the Discover Canada The Rights and Responsibilities of Citizenship book.
The app also includes questions organized into categories, which might help you develop in areas where you are lacking. You can challenge yourself by choosing different categories, each one has its own number of questions. There is an option to set up a timer, that makes the experience more like the real test.
Canadian Citizenship Test Prep keep records of your progress, but does not keep your data on any server, all stays in your device so your data is protected.
